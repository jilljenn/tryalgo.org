Some typos we spotted in the book.

- page 40 Figure 1.8: there should be two different gray shades among the rectangles. In the final print they might be too close to be distinguished.

- page 47, head of section 2.5: the second abra should be aligned with the suffix of the string abracadabra above.

- page 55: In the code of *powerstring_by_find*,  the variables *u* and *x* should be the same.

- page 115: the formula should be

$$    \frac{d'[n][v] - d'[k][v]}{n-k}  = \frac{d[n][v] - n\Delta - (d[k][v] - k\Delta)}{n-k}\\
     = \frac{d[n][v] - d[k][v] }{n-k} - \frac{n\Delta - k\Delta}{n-k}\\
     = \frac{d[n][v] - d[k][v] }{n-k} - \Delta$$

- page 143: the expression $\sum_{E_\ell}\ell$ should be instead $\sum \ell$, which stands for $\sum_{u\in U} \ell(u) + \sum_{v\in V} \ell(v)$.

- page 213: Indeed, an integer y can be written -> any composite integer y

- page 213: The inner loop should start at i * i instead of 2 * i for the announced complexity.

- page 240, last line: suffix of t begn inning -> beginning
