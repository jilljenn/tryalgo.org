## Other books & blogs

There are tons of books on algorithms. Most of them don't cover all the topics a well trained competitive programmer should learn, and many do not talk about implementation at all. Here is a personal selection among freely available books.

- [Algorithms, by Jeff Erickson](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/Algorithms-JeffE.pdf)
- [CP-Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com), responsive translations from Russian website [e-maxx.ru/algo](http://e-maxx.ru/algo)
- [Guide to competitive programming, by Antti Laaksonen](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-72547-5)
- [PEGWiki](https://wcipeg.com/wiki/Special:AllPages), the great wiki of the Programming Enrichment Group (Woburn Collegiate Institute, Toronto, Canada)

## GitHub repos of codes

- [matthewsamuel95/ACM-ICPC-Algorithms](https://github.com/matthewsamuel95/ACM-ICPC-Algorithms) (by algorithm then language)
- [kvaluruk/Data-Structures-And-Algorithms-â€¦](https://github.com/kvaluruk/Data-Structures-And-Algorithms-Hacktoberfest18) (by language then algorithm)
- [ZoranPandovski/al-go-rithms](https://github.com/ZoranPandovski/al-go-rithms) (messy)

## Visualisation
