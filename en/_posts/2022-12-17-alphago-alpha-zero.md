title: AlphaGo and Alpha Zero
author: Jill-Jênn Vie
---

In December 2016 we presented it at ENS Paris-Saclay with Étienne Simon but apparently I never wrote a blog post in the end.

- [Original AlphaGo paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature24270) in Nature
- [Original AlphaZero paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815)
- [Very nice blog post](https://web.stanford.edu/~surag/posts/alphazero.html) and [very nice code](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general) with a ready-to-try player on Othello 8x8 (or 6x6 trained in 3 days); however it is too weak for my current needs :/
