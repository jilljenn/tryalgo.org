Explanations for the problem [Halum](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=25&page=show_problem&problem=2473).  Please read the problem first.


## This is a negative cycle detection problem

> First observe that the operations Halum commute. The order in which they are applied does not matter and there is no need to apply it twice for a same vertex.

Let K be the lower bound on the arc weights we want to obtain.  Suppose that we call ```Halum(v,d[v])``` for some values ```d[v]```  on every vertex v.  This means that we have the following lower bound on the arc weights:

    w[u,v]+d[u]-d[v]≥K

Does it ring a bell?  This is exactly the inequality that appears in the shortest path problem.  Hence for fixed K the goal is to find potentials d that satisfy these inequalities for a graph with arc weights ```w[u,v]-K```.  It is known that there is a solution if and only if the graph has no negative cycle.  To convince yourself just notice that if you add up the arc inequalities along a cycle, the potentials cancel out and you are left with an equality stating that the total arc weights along the cycle have to be non-negative.

So you could just run a negative cycle detection algorithm for a fixed K, and use binary search to detect the optimal K.  The domain of K is ```[-|V|*10000,+|V|*10000]```, so the binary search stops after \\(log_2(10^{7})\\leq 24\\) iterations.
