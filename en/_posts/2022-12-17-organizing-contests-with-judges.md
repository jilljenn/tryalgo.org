## SPOJ

You need to send them a mail to get access to contest creation.

- [ ] Allow languages
- [ ] Access verification on view
- [ ] Copy pb statement (HTML editor) / select languages / add testcases

Good points:

- Very functional
- Interactive evaluation is available (never used it)
- Possible to have your own solution checker, but it is not that well documented (broken link; had to find it elsewhere on the forum)

## Kattis

- [ ] Don't forget to start the timer otherwise people won't be able to submit.

Good points:

- Great and easy-to-use interface
- Easy to set up existing problems in minutes
- Also possible to have your own solution checker (don't know how it works yet)
- Possible to export maths as MathML (that can be embedded in SPOJ)

Haven't tried to add new problems yet. Looking forward to it.
